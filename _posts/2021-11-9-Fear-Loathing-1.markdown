# Fear and Loathing in Cyberspace: Origins

###### If you’re reading this now,

I don’t need to explain the extent to which the internet becomes a bigger and bigger part of our lives with each passing day. From Zoom calls with your grandparents to ransomware that impacts the national oil supply, everyone, individuals and institutions alike, are being impacted by the dawn of a digital age. Jason Healey teaches at the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs, and prior to that, was a plank holder for the Joint Task Force for Global Network Operations, widely considered to be the world’s first joint cyber warfighting unit. A deep subject matter expert on networked conflict, Healey offers that “the internet may have surpassed Johannes Gutenberg’s printing press as history's most transformative invention because of how it has spawned parallel and simultaneous revolutions across other technologies”. Computers, software, and the internet have conspired to disrupt industry after industry, jolting markets and cultural norms just the same. As software eats the world and humanity climbs further and further onto the Web, the internet has become a new frontier where nation-states compete. Cyberspace. The rise of cyberspace as a stage for state interaction has profound implications for both the study and practice of international politics. In 2010, a uranium enrichment facility at Natanz in Iran, shutdown production due to a computer worm suspected to have been produced by the United States. This opening bell of cyberspace age was only a decade ago and holding the nuclear analogy constant allows that humanity is likely in the nascent days of this new paradigm, like trudging through the cold Korean winters of the early Cold War. I write all that to write this, that the norms of state behavior in cyberspace are still evolving, as are the analytical frameworks that organizations use to assess the space and the heuristics leaders use to operate within it.

###### As the digital world engulfs us,

and norms and heuristics change, an abundance of opportunities for analysis present themselves to better understand how cybersecurity is changing international politics. Over the next few weeks, I will release writing that explores the foreign policy decision making process behind two hacks that impacted American organizations. The first, a hack in 2014 of Sony Pictures, the movie studio behind American cultural objects such as The Karate Kid or Spiderman and the second, the infamous hack of the Democratic National Committee that weaved its way through the US presidential election in 2016. Both happened under the leadership of President Obama, a constant underlying condition that can help us compare and contrast the two intrusions. The United States remains a global superpower, so assessing the Obama administration’s tactics and strategy in the nascent days of the cyber age can aid us in projecting how the norms of the global internet will evolve in the coming months and years. The two intrusions will illustrate similarities and differences, and this project will use a variety of analytical frameworks, from emotions such as fear and loathing, to economics and game theory to examine just how the dawn of the cyber age is transforming statecraft in ways that range from alien to familiar, but are all deeply profound.

###### Given the relative youth of cybersecurity
as both a geopolitical challenge and an object of intellectual scrutiny, this project will rely heavily on the work of prominent academics and journalists to flesh out the contours of these new challenges. The work of the aforementioned Professor Healey will make many appearances, as will the writing of journalist David Sanger, a renowned cybersecurity reporter with the New York Times, specifically through his comprehensive account of the formative years of cyber conflict, The Perfect Weapon. The events at hand also involve foreign leaders, specifically Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin, meaning that analysis of their decision making processes can only be based on secondary sources regarding the events being assessed. Given this information environment, it must be acknowledged that the appearance of new, first hand information could alter the conclusions of the project. Indeed, this “grey zone” of incomplete information is analogous to the information environment that foreign policy decision makers often find themselves operating within when it comes to digital conflict. Indeed, later in the project, there will be an examination of how a leader's awareness of their incomplete information about the extent of their adversary’s intrusion or capabilities can shape the choices they make.

###### After the two intrusions have been placed in conversation,
they will be analyzed through traditional modes of foreign policy decision making, analysis that will rely on traditional international affairs literature from prominent academics such as Robert Jarvis, Keren Yarhi Milo, Todd Hall, and many more. Incorporating a traditional framework of analysis such as psychological assessments of leaders, the impact of secrecy, and domestic audience costs will allow for a robust assessment of how digital conflict fits into pre-existing frameworks of international relations analysis and to illuminate the ways in which they fall short of understanding this complex new arena of state interaction.

###### The work of Prussian General and early strategic thinker Carl Von Clausewitz can be famously summarized that "war is but a continuation of politics by other means".
As humanity descends deeper into the digital age, hacking gives states and their leaders a new means for achieving their political objectives, which also is easily calibrated to avoid escalation into broader military conflict. Much like the advent of nuclear weapons, this adds a permanent new condition to the geopolitical arena, albeit one with consequences that could be orders of magnitude more complex. I appreciate you taking the time to read this first piece in this series, and if you are so inclined to explore further, I have compiled a list of additional readings below. The series will continue next week with the story of how Seth Rogan and James Franco ignited a firestorm of geopolitical intrigue.
