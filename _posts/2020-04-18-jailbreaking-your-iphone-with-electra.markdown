 In this post we'll cover the process of jailbreaking your iPhone with Coolstar's [Electra](https://coolstar.org/electra/). 

The first step is to download the latest version from the link above. At the time of writing that is version 1.0.4. Once you've downloaded the IPA you'll need to plug your device into your computer and launch [Cydia Impactor](http://www.cydiaimpactor.com/).

Simply drag the Electra.ipa file to Impactor and click Start. You'll then be prompted for an Apple ID and password. We recommend creating an app-specific password which can be done by visiting [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/#!&page=signin).

After you've entered your Apple ID and password click Ok and the installation process will begin. When the installation is complete find the Electra app icon on your device and tap Jailbreak. 

> We recommend installing Electra **without** tweaks. A few of our other guides also suggest this as it makes installing and cracking certain apps easier.

Once the process is complete you've successfully jailbroken your iPhone.
