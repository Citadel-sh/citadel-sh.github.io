North Korean hackers, death threats, Kim Jong Un, and Seth Rogen. Peanut butter and jelly. Pancakes and syrup. When I think about Seth Rogen, of course the first thing that comes to mind is intense, deconstructed geopolitical conflict. It’s only a natural progression for a man who has brought us such thoughtful cinema as Pineapple Express or Knocked Up. I’m actually genuinely quite a fan of Rogen’s, but it speaks to the strange, intractable nature of this new manner of state conflict that he would find himself at the center of a long running feud between Kim Jong Un and the US government. Rogen and his perennial partner-in-absurdity, James Franco, were set to release their satirical film, The Interview, around Christmas of 2014. The film had been produced by Sony Pictures, and centered around two journalists, working for a TMZ-style entertainment organization, who were recruited by the CIA to assassinate Kim Jong Un. Predictably enough, hijinks ensue. The marketing materials for the film were cut in the style of North Korean propaganda, and the story features fake groceries full of plastic food, and ends with the brutal on-screen death of the North Korean leader, his head exploding as the bridge to the song Firework by Katy Perry plays softly. Advertising for the film began months before it’s scheduled debut. In June 2014, the North Korean government declared “making and releasing a movie on a plot to hurt our top-level leadership is the most blatant act of terrorism and war and will absolutely not be tolerated” and threatened “merciless countermeasures”. This was the kind of typical sabre rattling that emanated from Pyongyang several times a year, in response to a litany of perceived slights or stratagems against them. The North Korean Foreign Ministry also sent “a searing letter of protest to the secretary-general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, demanding that he intervene to stop the movie’s distribution”. Clearly, the film had made an impression amongst the highest levels of the North Korean government, and yet, given that these threats were issued prior to the development of long range weapons that could credibly threaten the American homeland, that level of alarm was not reciprocated within the US foreign policy apparatus. The CEO of Sony Pictures at the time, was a man named Michael Lynton. Lynton was a career film executive, and a standard business background, graduating with an MBA from Harvard Business School in the late 80s. He was rattled by the rhetoric emanating from Pyongyang and contacted Danny Russel who at the time was serving in the State Department as the Assistant  Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. Russel recognized that it wouldn’t be appropriate for the government to dictate to a private business a course of action, but shared the consensus in Washington that much of the vitriol emanating from Pyongyang was toothless. This assessment would turn out to be deeply flawed. It’s essential to note that the logic underwriting the assessment of impotence of the North Korean government's rhetoric was tied to traditional notions of force. Pyongyang didn’t have the ability to kill American moviegoers or bomb Sony headquarters, and as such, the risk to Sony, and by extension the security of the United States, was low. This assessment did not account for a new type of weapon, deployed on a different kind of battlefield, with goals entirely different from traditional state conflict.

6 weeks before the scheduled release of the film, in November of 2014, Lynton received word that unauthorized actors had gained access to Sony Pictures’ internal computer network. Computer screens all across the Sony organization were displaying an image of Lynton’s head, photoshopped so as to appear as though it had been violently severed from his body. However, shocking the image, it was merely a distraction while the intruder destroyed hard drives and extracted sensitive data from Sony’s systems. Sony contacted the FBI, and before long the attackers, calling themselves the Guardians of Peace, began to leak documents first through an anonymous service called Pastebin, and later through Wikileaks. The intruders “doled out emails with embarrassing details about the studio, along with Sony contracts, a few medical records, and plenty of Social Security numbers,” even managing to acquire multiple unreleased films produced by the movie studio. Experts estimate that as high as 70% of Sony’s internal computers were compromised by the Guardians of Peace hack. The threats emanating from Pyongyang had been considered an affair for Sony to navigate more or less on their own, but now they had been pulled firmly into the geopolitical realm.

In the Situation Room, President Obama and his national security team found themselves facing a familiar adversary in a novel circumstance, a circumstance deeply complicated by the two facts. One, not a single drop of American blood had been shed in the incident, and two, that the process of attributing cyber breaches to a specific actor is a highly technical and opaque process. According to prominent cyber journalist David Sanger, the American government “found what we were looking for very quickly,” one White House official proclaimed, describing evidence that appeared to provide a direct communications link between the Reconnaissance General Bureau [A North Korean State Intelligence Organ] and the actual hackers [Guardians of Peace]. Even today, the US government has never revealed its evidence—in the Sony case or in other instances of North Korean hacking—because it does not want to tip its hand about what kind of monitoring may be ongoing”. Ten days after the initial intrusion, as internal Sony material drip-dropped out into the media landscape, full of salacious details and Hollywood gossip that proved to be irresistible catnip to the American media, the Guardians of Peace released a statement asserting that “soon all the world will see what an awful movie Sony Pictures Entertainment has made. The world will be full of fear. Remember the 11th of September 2001.” The implied threat of violence rattled Lynton, who immediately suspended the theatrical release of the film.

The next day, December 19, 2014, President Obama publicly attributed the hacks to the North Korean government, but failed to provide technical evidence, setting off a firestorm of speculation and debate within the cybersecurity community. Obama also “vowed that a proportional response would happen “in a place and time and manner that we choose.” This opacity reveals a consistent condition of state-led cyber conflict. State actors often feel the need to impose in-kind costs to disruptions of their cyberspace, but prefer to keep the depth of their penetration into their adversaries networks close to the chest. This will not be the last time that this dynamic appears in explorations of cyberspace. Beyond threats of retaliation, President Obama decried Lynton’s decision to pull the film from theatres, asserting that Americans should not allow “a dictator someplace [to] start imposing censorship here in the United States," and declared that the hack was "was an act of cyber-vandalism that was very costly, very expensive. We take it very seriously. We will respond proportionately." The Obama Administration had concluded that movie studios were not the kind of critical infrastructure on which a deep cyber intrusion would qualify as an act of war. This established a new norm surrounding how the US would respond to cyberattacks, allowing that there were aggressive actions that could be taken against the United States in cyberspace, that if finely tuned, would not end in the wrath of God being dropped from B-2 bombers on the attackers head. Categorizing the hacks as criminal mischief or vandalism allows adversaries a certain freedom of maneuver in the digital world, gifting them the knowledge that there are intrusions that can be used to impose cost on American organizations or shape American behavior that will not draw the massive power of the US military, a much more traditional tool of statecraft. It is nearly impossible to imagine a world where a bomb goes off in Sony Pictures parking lot and the perpetrators aren’t hunted to the ends of the earth, but cyberspace brings with it new boundaries, and adversaries can more finely tune their attacks to achieve their desired effect while avoiding direct confrontation with the American state.

 Ultimately, the Obama administration responded to the hacks by levying economic sanctions against North Korea, although the efficacy of such a response is debatable given the crush of sanctions that already existed against Pyongyang in response to their nuclear weapons program. However, the norms surrounding the American response were set and had been noted by our enemies around the world, and mere months later, an adversary with a much higher degree of sophistication and organization would take advantage of those same norms, albeit with their eyes trained on something much, much more important than a movie studio
